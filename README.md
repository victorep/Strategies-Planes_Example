A simple implementation of Strategy Pattern using planes.

Output should be something like this :

        A jet plane for cargo with retractable wheels
        I have jet engines
        I have retractable wheels
        I only carry cargo!

        A propelor plane for persons with retractable wheels
        I have jet engines
        I have retractable wheels
        I only carry persons and their luggage!

        A propelor plane for cargo with fixed wheels
        I have jet engines
        I have fixed wheels. I can't fly that fast :(
        I only carry cargo!
